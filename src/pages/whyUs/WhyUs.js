                    <p>
                    Our community started with like minded individuals wanting to learn and nerd together in May of 2019. It has truly become one of a kind. We started by hosting live study sessions daily, and holding each other accountable as we went through bootcamps and wrapped up other IT courses. Since then, our founding members have landed multiple tech jobs, started teaching classes, and began mentoring others. We have decided to continue to pay it forward and create this project to help more folks like us break into the tech industry. 
                    We continue to host weekly study sessions, resume review workshops, job referrals, give educational advice, work on open source projects, and even career coaching; all for FREE! Many people try to navigate a new career and find a community on their own, but in the YNA family you will always have someone and/or something that you can not find anywhere else. We are a close tech family, all starting from zero and now working together to reach the stars. If this sounds like a community that you can either thrive in or want to recruit talent from, come join us!
